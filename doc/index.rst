PowerPool: A flexible mining server
=====================================

Features
--------------

* Lightweight, asynchronous, gevent based internals.
* Built in HTTP statistics/monitoring server.
* Flexible statistics collection engine.
* Multiple coinserver (RPC server) support for redundancy. Support for
  coinserver prioritization.
* Redis driven share logging allows multiple servers to log shares and
  statistics to a central source for easy scaling out.
* SHA256, X11, scrypt, and scrypt-n support
* Support for merge mining multiple auxilury (merge mined) blockchains
* Modular architecture makes customization simple(r)

Uses Redis to log shares and statistics for miners. Work generation and
(bit|lite|alt)coin data structure serialization is performed by `Cryptokit
<https://github.com/simplecrypto/cryptokit>`_ and connects to bitcoind using
GBT for work generation (or getauxblock for merged work).  Currently only
Python 2.7 is supported.

Built to power the `SimpleMulti <http://simplemulti.com>`_ mining pool.
